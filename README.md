# SVR-Intuition
Truth or Bluff using SVR model.
The dataset and prediction aim is same as previous model https://github.com/Hamza-Rayyan/Polynomial_linear_regression

#  About SVR in very short manner.
  - Support Vector Regression have a line line which is surrounded by a tube structure call epcilon Insensitive Tube.
  - Anything that falls or any data-point fall in the ep-insensitive tube is being ignored or will be disregradded error.
  - The distance between the linear line and the tube end is the margin of error we are allowing.
  - We care about the dataset points outside the tube
  - in here we more focus on the distance b/w data-points outside the tube and how it can be minimized which gives the shape to the tube.
